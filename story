story :
Once upon a time in a forest there lived a monkey who decided on a jamoon tree. 
The tree was on the banks on a river and in that same river there lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day the crocodile came to the banks of the river to get the fruit and so did the monkey.
Both of them kept coming everyday to get teh fruit and they became good friends.
The crocodile's wife found these fruits very yummy
